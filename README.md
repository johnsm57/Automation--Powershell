# Automation--Powershell
Automation project for migrating users to Office 365
A company I worked for required some Powershell knowledge and I noticed that instead of migrating one use0 through
azure to have sharepoint online and Microsoft O365, they would allow the Content Management team to be able to upload a CSV (Excel related file)
with hundreds if not thousands of users on one. After formatting the csv file correctly, I was able to upload the metadata to be able to run the script and migrate multiple users. 
I did not know the sciprt by heart and due to working for the company, copying and pasting the script would be prohibited..
So instead, I recreated it for myself as a powershell automation project.
